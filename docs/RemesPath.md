RemesPath documentation
========================

RemesPath is a JSON query language inspired by [JMESpath](https://jmespath.org/) with such useful features as
* indexing in objects with both dot syntax and square bracket syntax
* [boolean indexing](#boolean-indexing)
* [vectorized arithmetic](#vectorized-operations)
* many built-in [functions](#functions), both [vectorized](#vectorized-functions) and not
* [regular expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference) functions
* [recursive search](#recursive-search) for keys
* SQL-like group_by capabilities (see non-vectorized functions)
* reshaping and summarization of JSON using [projections](#projections)
* [editing of JSON](#editing-with-assignment-expressions)

The formal description of the language in pseudo-Backus-Naur form is in ["RemesPath language spec.txt"](/docs/RemesPath%20language%20spec.txt). I'm not 100% sure this is a formally valid language spec, though.

## Indexing and selecting keys ##

1. `@` selects the entirety of an object or array.
2. [Python-style slices](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/509211/understanding-slicing) and indices can be used to select parts of an array. For example:
    * `@[1]` selects the second element
    * `@[-4]` selects the fourth-to-last element
    * `@[:3]` selects the first, second and third elements
    * `@[5::2]` selects every other element of the array starting with the fifth.
3. You can select multiple slices and indices in the same square brackets!
    * `@[1, 5:8, -1]` selects the second, sixth, seventh, eight, and last elements.
4. Dot syntax and square brackets are both valid ways to select keys of an object.
    * `@.bar` and `@[bar]` both select the value corresponding to a single key `bar`.
    * You can select multiple keys from a single object by enclosing all of them in square brackets. You *cannot* follow a dot with square brackets.
        * So `@[foo, bar, baz]` gets the values associated with keys `foo`, `bar`, and `baz`.
    * Backticks (\`) can be used to enquote strings. Thus ``@.`bar` ``and ``@[`bar`]`` are equivalent to `@.bar` and `@[bar]`.
    * The literal backtick character \` can be rendered by an escaped backtick \\\` inside a backtick-enclosed string.
    * Any string that does not *begin* with an underscore or an ASCII letter and *contain* only underscores, ASCII letters, and digits *must* be enclosed in backticks.
        * So `@.a12`, `@._`, `@.a_1`, but ``@[`1_a`]``.
5. Each time you select an index or key, the next index selected from the corresponding value(s).
    1. Consider the array `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.
        * `@[:2][1]` selects the second element of each of the first and second elements of that array. So `@[:2][1]` will return `[2, 4]`.
    2. Consider the array of objects `[{"a": 1, "b": ["_"]}, {"a": 2, "b": ["?"]}]`.
        * `@[:].b[0]` will return the first value of the array child of key `b` in each object, so `["_", "?"]`.
        * `@[0][b, a]` will return keys `{"a": 1, "b": ["_"]}`. 
            * *Note that the order of keys in the index is not preserved because objects are inherently unordered.*
6. If every indexer in a chain of indexers returns only one index/key, the query will not return an array or object containing the result; it will only return the result.
    1. Consider again the array `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.
        * Query `@[0][1]` returns `2`.
    2. Consider again the array of objects `[{"a": 1, "b": ["_"]}, {"a": 2, "b": ["?"]}]`.
        * Query `@[1].b` returns `["?"]`.
        * Query `@[0].b[0]` returns `"_"`.

## Vectorized operations ##

1. Many operations are *vectorized* in RemesPath. That is, they are applied to every element in an iterable.
    1. Consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
        * `2 * @` returns `[2, 4, 6]`.
        * `str(@)` returns `["1", "2", "3"]` because `str` is a vectorized function for converting things to their string representations.
        * @ + @ / 2 returns `[1.5, 3.0, 4.5]`.
        * `@ > @[1]` returns `[false, false, true]`.
    2. Consider the object `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`.
        * `@ ** @` returns `{"a": 1.0, "b": 4.0, "c": 27.0}`
        * `@ & 1` returns `{"a": 1, "b": 0, "c": 1}`.
        * `@ > @.a` returns `{"a": false, "b": true, "c": true}`.

## Binary operators and arithmetic ##

All binary operators in RemesPath are vectorized over iterables.

The binary operators in RemesPath are as follows:

Symbol | Operator                                      | Precedence | Return type
-------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------
 `&`   |  bitwise/logical `AND`                        |  0         | int/bool
 `\|`   |  bitwise/logical `OR`                        |  0         | int/bool
 `^`   |  bitwise/logical `XOR`                        |  0         | int/bool
 `=~`  |  string matches regex                         |  1         | bool
 `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | the usual comparison operators | 1 | bool
 `+`   | Addition of numbers, concatenation of strings   |  2         | int/float/string
 `-`   | subtraction                                   |  2         | int/float
 `//`  | floor division                                |  3         | int
 `%`   | modulo                                        |  3         | int/float
 `*`   | multiplication                                |  3         | int/float
 `/`   | division                                      |  3         | float
 `**`  | exponentiation                                |  5         | float

As in normal math, the unary minus operator (e.g., `-5`) has lower precedence than exponentation.

All binary operators are [left-associative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_associativity) (evaluated left-to-right when precedence is tied), except exponentation (`**`), which is right-associative.


## Regular expressions and JSON literals ##

A regular expression can be created in a RemesPath expression by prefixing a \`\` string with the character "g". So ``g`\\s+` ``is the regular expression "\\s+", i.e., at least one whitespace character.

A JSON literal can be created inside a RemesPath expression by prefixing a \`\` string with the character "j". So ``j`[1, 2, 3]` ``creates the JSON array `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Regular expression indexing in objects ###

You can select all the keys of an object that match a regular expression by using a regular expression with the dot or square bracket syntax.

__Examples:__
* Consider the object `{"foo": 1, "bar": 2, "baz": 3}`.
* ``@.g`^b` ``returns `{"bar": 2, "baz": 3}`.
* ``@[g`r$`, foo]`` returns `{"bar": 2, "foo": 1}`.

## Boolean indexing ##

You can select all elements in an iterable that satisfy a condition by applying a boolean index.

A boolean index can be one of the following:
* A single boolean. If it's `false`, an empty array is returned (*it's always an array, even for one-element boolean indices on objects*). If it's true, the whole iterable is returned.
    * Consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`
    * e.g., `@[in(2, @)]` will return `[1, 2, 3]` because `in(2, @)` is `true`.
    * `@[in(4, @)]` will return `[]` because `in(4, @)` is `false`.
* *If the iterable is an __array__, an array of booleans of the same length as the iterable*. An array with all the values for which the boolean index was `true` will be returned.
    * Consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`
    * `@[@ > @[0]]` will return `[2, 3]`.
    * `@[@ ** 2 < 1]` will return `[]`.
    * `@[@[:2] > 0]` will throw a VectorizedArithmeticException, because the boolean index has length 2 and the array has length 3. 
* *If the iterable is an __object__, an object of booleans with exactly the same keys as the iterable.* An object will be returned with all the pairs k: v for which the boolean index's value corresponding to k was `true`.
    * Consider the object `{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}`
    * `@[@ > @.a]` returns `{"b": 2, "c": 3}`.
    * `@[@[a,b] > 1]` will throw a VectorizedArithmeticException, because the boolean index is `{"a": false, "b": true}`, which does not have exactly the same keys as the object.

## Grouping parentheses ##

Grouping parentheses work exactly the way you expect them to with arithmetic expressions.
* `2 ** 3 / (4 - 5)` evaluates to `8/-1` and thus returns `-8.0`.

Grouping parentheses can also be used to make the query parser treat a single expression as atomic.
* Consider the object `[{"a": [1, 2, 3]}]`.
* The query `@[:].a[@ > @[0]]` returns `[[2, 3]]`. In pseudo-code, this would be:
```
make an array arr
for each object obj in this
    make a subarray subarr
    for each element in obj[a]
       if element > obj[a][0], add element to subarr
    add subarr to arr
return arr
```
* However, we *can't* select the first element of each array by just making the query `@[:].a[@ > @[0]][0]`. This will throw an error.
* That's because the query has already descended to the level of individual elements, and we can't index on the individual elements.
* Instead, we enclose the original query in grouping parentheses: `(@[:].a[@ > @[0]])`.
* Now we can select the first element of each array as follows: `(@[:].a[@ > @[0]])[:][0]`.

## Recursive search ##
* Suppose you have really deep JSON, but all you really want is a certain key in an object.
* For example, consider the JSON `[[[{"a": 1, "b": 2}], [{"a": 3, "b": 4}]]]`.
* You can recursively search for the key "a" in this JSON with *double-dot* syntax `@..a`. This will return `[1, 3]`.
* You can also recursively search for the keys "b" and "a" with the query `@..[b, a]`. This will return `[2, 1, 4, 3]`.

### Recursively find all descendents ###

*Added in v3.7.0*

`@..*` will return a single array containing all the *scalar* descendents of the current JSON, no matter their depth.

It will not return indices or parents, only the child nodes

For example, the `@..*` query on JSON
```json
{"a": [true, 2, [3]], "b": {"c": ["d", "e"], "f": null}}
```

will return

```json
[true, 2, 3, "d", "e", null]
```

## Functions ##
RemesPath supports a variety of functions, some of which are [vectorized](#vectorized-functions) and some of which are not.

We'll present the non-vectorized functions separately from the vectorized ones to avoid confusion.

Each subset will be organized in alphabetical order.

### Non-vectorized functions ###

`add_items(obj: object, k1: string, v1: anything, [k2: string, v2: anything, k3: string, v3: anything, k4: string, v4: anything]) -> object`

Takes 3-9 arguments. As shown, every even-numbered argument must be a string (new keys).

Returns a *new object* with the key-value pair(s) k1-v1 (and possibly k2-v2, k3-v3, and k4-v4 added).

*Does not mutate the original object.*

__EXAMPLES__
- add_items({}, "a", 1, "b", 2, "c", 3, "d", 4) -> {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4}

-----
`append(x: array, x2-x8: anything) -> array`

Takes an array and 1-7 other things (any *not-null* JSON) and returns a *new array* with
the other things added to the end of the first array.

Does not mutate the original array.

The other things are added in the order that they were passed as arguments.

Note that since `null` arguments are ignored, you will have to use `concat` with an array of `null` to add `null`'s to the end of an array. 

__EXAMPLES__
- `append([], 1, false, "a", [4]) -> [1, false, "a", [4]]`

-----
`avg(x: array) -> float`

Finds the arithmetic mean of an array of numbers. `mean` is an alias for this function.

-----
`concat(x: array | object, x2-x8: array | object) -> array | object`

Takes 2-8 arguments, either all arrays or all objects.

If all args are arrays, returns an array that contains all elements of
every array passed in, in the order they were passed.

If all args are objects, returns an object that contains all key-value pairs in
all the objects passed in.

If multiple objects have the same keys, objects later in the arguments take precedence.

__EXAMPLES__
- `concat([1, 2], [3, 4], [5])` -> `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- `concat({"a": 1, "b": 2}, {"c": 3}, {"a": 4})` -> `{"b": 2, "c": 3, "a": 4}`
- `concat([1, 2], {"a": 2})` raises an exception because you can't concatenate arrays with objects.
- `concat(1, [1, 2])` raises an exception because you can't concatenate anything with non-iterables.

-----
`dict(x: array) -> object`

If x is an array of 2-element subarrays where the first element in each subarray is a string, return an object where each subarray is converted to a key-value pair.

__Example:__
* `dict([["a", 1], ["b", 2]])` returns `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`.

----
`flatten(x: array, depth: int = 1]) -> array`
   
Recursively searches in `x` down to a depth of `depth`, pulling each element of every sub-array at that depth into the final array.

It's easier to understand with some __examples:__
* `flatten([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
* `flatten([1, 2, 3])` returns `[1, 2, 3]`.
* `flatten([1, [2, [3]]])` returns `[1, 2, [3]]`.
* `flatten([1, [2, [3, [4]]]], 3)` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

----
`group_by(x: array, k: int | str) -> object`

* If `x` is an array of *arrays*:
   * If `k` is *not* an int, throw an error.
   * Return an object where key `str(v)` has an array of sub-arrays `subarr` such that `subarr[k] == v` is `true`.
   * Note that `subarr[k]` might not be a string in these sub-arrays. However, keys in JSON objects must be strings, so the key is the string representation of `subarr[k]` rather than `subarr[k]` itself.
* If `x` is an array of *objects*:
   * If `k` is *not* a string, throw an error.
   * Return an object where key `str(v)` has an array of sub-objects `subobj` such that `subobj[k] == v` is `true`.
   * Note that `subobj[k]` might not be a string in these sub-objects.
* If `x` is an array of anything else, or it has a mixture of arrays an objects, throw an error.

----
`in(elt: anything, itbl: object | array) -> bool`

* If `itbl` is an *array*:
    * if `elt` has a type that is not comparable with an element of `itbl`, throws an error. 
    * returns `true` if `elt` is equal to any element.
* If `itbl` is an *object*:
    * if `elt` is not a string, throws an error.
    * If `elt` is one of the keys in `itbl`, returns `true`.

----
`index(x: array, elt: anything, reverse: bool = false) -> int`

* If `reverse` is `false` (*default*): Returns the index of the *first* element in `x` that is equal to `elt`.
* If `reverse` is `true`: Returns the index of the *last* element in `x` that is equal to `elt`.
* If *no elements in x are equal to elt*, throws an error.

----
`items(x: object) -> array`

Returns an array of 2-item subarrays (the key-value pairs of `x`).

Because objects are not inherently ordered, you may need to sort the key-value pairs by their key or value to get the same result every time.

----
`keys(x: object) -> array`

Returns an array of the keys in `x`.

----
`len(x: object | array) -> int`

Returns the number of key-value pairs in `x` (if an object) or the number of elements in `x` (if an array).

----
`max(x: array) -> float`

Returns a floating-point number equal to the maximum value in an array.

----
`max_by(x: array, k: int | str) -> array | object`

* If `x` is an array of *arrays*:
   * If `k` is not an int, throw an error.
   * Return the subarray `maxarr` such that `maxarr[k] >= subarr[k]` for all sub-arrays `subarr` in `x`.
* If `x` is an array of *objects*:
    * If `k` is not a string, throw an error.
   * Return the subobject `maxobj` such that `maxobj[k] >= subobj[k]` for all sub-objects `subobj` in `x`.

----
`min(x: array) -> float`

Returns a floating-point number equal to the minimum value in an array.

----
`min_by(x: array, k: int | str) -> array | object`

See `max_by`.

---
`pivot(x: array[object | array], by: str | int, val_col: str | int, other_col4-other_col9: str | int) -> object[str, array]`

There can be at most *9* arguments to this function.

The first argument should be an array whose sub-iterables have a repeating cycle of values for one column (`by`), and the only other column that varies within a given cycle is the values column (`val_col`).

The result is an object where each distinct value of the `by` column is mapped to an array of the corresponding values in the `val_col` column. Additionally, you may include up to 6 other columns.

__Examples:__
- With
```json
[
    ["foo", 2, 3, true],
    ["bar", 3, 3, true],
    ["foo", 4, 4, false],
    ["bar", 5, 4, false]
]
```
as input, `pivot(@, 0, 1, 2, 3)` (use `0` as pivot, `1` as values, `2` and `3` as other columns) returns
```json
{
    "foo": [2, 4],
    "bar": [3, 5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [true, false]
}
```
- With
```json
[
    {"a": "foo", "b": 2, "c": 3},
    {"a": "bar", "b": 3, "c": 3},
    {"a": "foo", "b": 4, "c": 4},
    {"a": "bar", "b": 5, "c": 4}
]
```
as input, `pivot(@, a, b, c)` returns
```json
{
    "foo": [2, 4],
    "bar": [3, 5],
    "c": [3, 4]
}
```

----
`quantile(x: array, q: float) -> float`

x must contain only numbers.

q must be between 0 and 1, exclusive.

Returns the q^th quantile of `x`, as a floating-point number.

So `quantile(x, 0.5)` returns the median, `quantile(x, 0.75)` returns the 75th percentile, and so on.

Uses linear interpolation if the index found is not an integer.

For example, suppose that the 60th percentile is at index 6.6, and elements 6 and 7 are 8 and 10.

Then the returned value is `0.6*10 + 0.4*8`, or 9.2.

----
`range(start: int, end: int = null, step: int = 1) -> array[int]`

Returns an array of integers.

* If `end` and `step` are not supplied, return all the integers from 0 to start, excluding start.
   * So `range(3)` returns `[0, 1, 2]`
   * `range(-1)` returns `[]` because -1 is less than 0.
* If `step` is not supplied, return all the integers from `start` to `end`, excluding `end`.
   * `range(3, 5)` returns `[3, 4]`.
   * `range(3, 1)` returns `[]` because 1 is less than 3.
* If all arguments are supplied, return all the integers from `start` to `end`, incrementing by `step` each time.
   * `range(3, 1, -1)` returns `[3, 2]`.
   * `range(0, 6, 3)` returns `[0, 3]`.

----
`s_join(sep: string, x: array) -> string`

Every element of `x` must be a string.

Returns x string-joined with sep (i.e., returns a string that begins with `x[0]` and has `sep` between `x[i - 1]` and `x[i]` for `1 <= i <= len(x)`)

----
`sort_by(x: array, k: string | int, descending: bool = false)`

`x` must be an array of arrays (in which case `k` must be an int) or an array of objects (in which case `k` must be a string).

Returns a new array of subarrays/subobjects `subitbl` such that `subitbl[k]` is sorted ascending.

Analogous to SQL `ORDER BY`.

By default, these sub-iterables are sorted ascending. If `descending` is `true`, they will instead be sorted descending.

----
`sorted(x: array, descending: bool = false)`

`x` must be an array of all strings or all numbers. Either is fine so long as all elements are comparable.

Returns a new array where the elements are sorted ascending. If `descending` is `true`, they're instead sorted descending.

----
`sum(x: array) -> float`

Returns the sum of the elements in x. 

x must contain only numbers. Booleans are fine.

---
`to_records(x: iterable, [strategy: str]) -> array[object]`

Converts some iterable to an array of objects, using one of the [strategies](/docs/json-to-csv.md#strategies) used to make a CSV in the JSON-to-CSV form. The resulting JSON is just the JSON equivalent of the CSV that would be generated with `x` as input and the same strategy (each object has the same column types and same column names as the corresponding row of the CSV).

The strategy argument must be one of the following strings:
- 'd': [default](/docs/json-to-csv.md#default)
- 'r': [full recursive](/docs/json-to-csv.md#full-recursive)
- 'n': [no recursion](/docs/json-to-csv.md#no-recursion)
- 's': [stringify iterables](/docs/json-to-csv.md#stringify-iterables)

----
`unique(x: array, sorted: bool = false)`

Returns an array of all the unique elements in `x`. 

If `sorted` is true, sorts the array ascending. This will raise an error if not all of x's elements are comparable.

----
`value_counts(x: array)`

Returns an array of two-element subarrays `[k: anything, count: int]` where `count` is the number of elements in `x` equal to `k`.

The order of the sub-arrays is random.

----
`zip(x1: array, x2-x8: array) -> array`

There can only be at most *8* arguments to this function.

Returns a new array in which each `i^th` element is an array containing the `i^th` elements of each argument, in the order in which they were passed.

All the argument arrays *must have the same length*.

In other words, it's like the Python `zip` function, except it returns an array, not a lazy iterator.

__Example:__
* `zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3])` returns `[["a", 1], ["b", 2], ["c", 3]]`.

### Vectorized functions ###

All of these functions are applied separately to each element in an array or value in an object.

All the vectorized string functions have names beginning with `s_`.

----
`abs(x: number) -> number`

Returns the absolute value of x.

----
`float(x: number) -> number`

Returns a 64-bit floating-point number equal to x.

----
`ifelse(cond: bool, if_true: anything, if_false: anything) -> anything`

Returns `if_true` if `cond` is `true`, otherwise returns `if_false`.

----
`int(x: number) -> int`

* If x is a boolean or integer: returns a 64-bit integer equal to x.
* If x is a float: returns the closest 64-bit integer to x.
   * Note that this is *NOT* the same as the Python `int` function.

----
`is_expr(x: anything) -> bool`

Returns true if x is an array or object.

----
`is_num(x: anything) -> bool`

Returns true if x is a number.

----
`is_str(x: anything) -> bool`

Returns true if x is a string.

----
`isna(x: number) -> bool`

Returns true if x is the floating-point Not-A-Number (represented in some JSON by `NaN`).

Recall that `NaN` is *NOT* in the original JOSN specification.

----
`log(x: number, n: number = e) -> number`

Returns the log base `n` of `x`. If `n` is not specified, returns the natural log of `x`.

----
`log2(x: number) -> number`

Returns the log base 2 of x.

----
`not(x: bool) -> bool`

Logical `NOT`.

----
`round(x: number, sigfigs: int = 0) -> float | int)`

`x` must be an integer or a floating-point number, *not* a boolean.

* If sigfigs is 0: Returns the closest 64-bit integer to `x`.
* If sigfigs > 0: Returns the closest 64-bit floating-point number to `x` rounded to `sigfigs` decimal places.

----
`s_count(x: string, sub: regex | string) -> int`

Returns the number of times substring/regex `sub` occurs in `x`.

----
`s_find(x: string, sub: regex | string) -> array[string]`

Returns an array of all the substrings in `x` that match `sub`.

----
`s_len(x: string) -> int`

The length of string x.

----
`s_lower(x: string) -> string`

The lower-case form of x.

----
`s_mul(x: string, reps: int) -> string`

A string containing `x` repeated `reps` times. E.g., ``s_mul(`abc`, 3)`` returns `"abcabcabc"`.

Basically `x * reps` in Python, except that the binary operator `*` doesn't have that capability in RemesPath.

----
`s_slice(x: string, sli: slice | int) -> string`

`sli` can be an integer or slice with the same Python slice syntax used to index arrays (see above).

Returns the appropriate slice/index of `x`.

----
`s_split(x: string, sep: regex | string) -> array[string]`

If `sep` is a string:
* Returns an array containing all the substrings of `x` that don't contain `sep`, split by the places where `sep` occurs.
   * E.g., ``s_split(`abac`, `a`)`` returns `["", "b", "c"]`

If `sep` is a regex:
* Returns an array containing substrings of `x` where the parts that match `sep` are missing.
   * E.g., ``s_split(`a big bad man`, g`\\s+`)`` returns `["a", "big", "bad", "man"]`.
* However, if `sep` contains any capture groups, the capture groups are included in the array.
   * ``s_split(`a big bad man`, g`(\\s+)`)`` returns `["a", " " "big", " ", "bad", " ", "man"]`.
   * ``s_split(`bob num: 111-222-3333, carol num: 123-456-7890`, g`(\\d{3})-(\\d{3}-\\d{4})`)`` returns `["bob num: ", "111", "222-3333", ", carol num: ", "123", "456-7890", ""]`

----
`s_strip(x: string) -> string`

Strips the whitespace off both ends of x.

----
`s_sub(x: string, to_replace: regex | string, replacement: string) -> string`

Replaces all instances of string/regex `to_replace` in `x` with `replacement`.

See the [C# regular expressions reference on substitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference#substitutions).

----
`s_upper(x: string) -> string`

Returns the upper-case form of x.

----
`str(x: anything) -> string`

Returns the string representation of x.

## Projections ##

A __projection__ (a concept from JMESpath) is an iterable (either an object or an array) that is somehow based on the current JSON. Projections can be used to reshape JSON, capture summaries, and much more.

In RemesPath, a projection can be created by following a valid RemesPath query with a comma-separated list of elements or a comma-separated list of key-value pairs.

For example, suppose you have an array of arrays of numbers.
```json
[
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```
You might be interested in getting a list of the length of the array, the length of the first element of the array, and the length of the last element.

```
@{
    len(@), 
    len(@[0]), 
    len(@[-1])
}
``` 
returns 
```json
[3, 4, 3]
```

Or maybe you want to know the sum and average of each subarray.

`@[:]{sum(@), avg(@)}` returns

```json
[[10.0, 2.5],
 [11.0, 5.5],
 [24.0, 8.0]]
```

Or maybe you prefer to get that information as an object, so that the reader can more easily figure out what each row is.

`@[:]{row_sum: sum(@), row_avg: avg(@)}` returns

```json
[
    {"row_avg": 2.5, "row_sum": 10.0},
    {"row_avg": 5.5, "row_sum": 11.0}, 
    {"row_avg": 8.0, "row_sum": 24.0}
]
```

These projections can themselves be queried, allowing you to do perform some SQL-like analyses of your data.

Suppose you want to know the average and length of the two rows that have the highest average.

```
sort_by(
    @[:]
        {`len`: len(@), `avg`: avg(@)},
    `avg`,
    true
)[:2]
```
returns
```json
[
    {"avg": 8.0, "len": 3},
    {"avg": 5.5, "len": 2}
]
```

Note that in this example, we're using quotes around the key names `avg` and `len` to indicate that they're being used as strings and not function names. Otherwise the parser will get confused.

## Editing with assignment expressions ##

*Added in version v2.0.0*

A RemesPath query can contain at most one `=` separating two valid expressions. This is the __assignment operator__.

The LHS of the assignment expression is typically a query that selects items from a document (e.g., `@.foo[@ > 0]`).

The RHS is typically a scalar (if you want to give everything queried the same value) or a function like `@ + 1`.

If the RHS is a function and the LHS is an iterable, the RHS is applied separately to each element of the iterable.

### Limitations ###
1. Until further notice, you __cannot__ mutate an object or array, other than to change its scalar elements
    * For example, the query `@ = len(@)` on JSON `[[1, 2, 3]]` will fail, because this ends up trying to mutate the subarray `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. You also cannot mutate a non-array or non-object into an array or object. For example, the query ``@[0] = j`[1]` ``on the input `[0]` will fail because you're trying to convert a scalar (the integer `1`) to an array (`[1]`).

An assignment expression mutates the input and then returns the input.

In these examples, we'll use the input
```json
{
    "foo": [-1, 2, 3],
    "bar": "abc",
    "baz": "de"
}
```

Some examples:
* The query `@.foo[@ < 0] = @ + 1` will yield `{"foo": [0, 2, 3], "bar": "abc", "baz": "de"}`
* The query `@.bar = s_slice(@, :2)` will yield `{"foo": [-1, 2, 3], "bar": "ab", "baz": "de"}`
* The query `@.g``b`` = s_len(@)` will yield `{"foo": [-1, 2, 3], "bar": 3, "baz": 2}`
