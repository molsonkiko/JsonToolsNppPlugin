// If you want to translate JsonTools into another language, follow these steps (in the example below, we are translating into the "fooish" language):
// 1. Create a copy of this file at the path "translation/fooish.json5" relative to the JsonTools plugin directory (the directory where the JsonTools.dll binary is installed, *not* the plugin config directory).
// 2. If you are not 100% certain you understand all the rules of JSON syntax, read https://www.json.org/json-en.html
// 3. Edit the values associated with the various keys in this document. Here are some rules that you must follow.
//     i. DO NOT CHANGE THE KEYS OF ANY OBJECT, OR ADD OR REMOVE KEYS! ONLY CHANGE THE VALUES.
//     ii. Some of these values will have "{integer}" in their text,
//         like the "{0}" and "{1}" in "Found '{0}' after key {1} when colon expected".
//         When you see "{1}" in a value, this means "insert the 2nd piece of extra information required to render this message".
//         When translating these values, it is VERY IMPORTANT that your translation includes all the "{integer}" occurrences.
//         EXAMPLES OF TRANSLATING "Found '{0}' after key {1} when colon expected" TO ITALIAN:
//         GOOD: "Trovato '{0}' dopo la chiave {1} quando erano previsti i due punti"
//         BAD (missing "{0}"): "Trovato '' dopo la chiave {1} quando erano previsti i due punti"
//         BAD (missing "{1}"): "Trovato '{0}' dopo la chiave {} quando erano previsti i due punti"
//         BAD (has "{0.}" instead of "{0}"): "Trovato '{0.}' dopo la chiave {1} quando erano previsti i due punti"
//     iii. The following words are keywords and MUST BE PRESERVED EXACTLY (including case).
//         - null
//         - true
//         - false
//         - NaN
//         - Infinity
//         - None
//         - True
//         - False
//         - nan
//         - inf
//         - undefined
//     iv. The ', ", and ` characters have specific meanings, and CANNOT BE USED INTERCHANGABLY.
//         If you see 'x' in one place, `x` in another place, and "x" in a third place, assume that this was an intentional choice by molsonkiko, and leave it unchanged.
//     v. If you see a word surrounded in \" or ' or ` inside a value, it is a keyword, so don't change it.
// 4a. Go to the settings and change the `logger_level` setting to JSON5.
// 4b. Use the "Check JSON syntax now" command to make sure that this document has no syntax errors with a severity of BAD or FATAL.
// 5. Close Notepad++ and reopen it, then look at the various JsonTools forms and menu items to see if the translation is satisfactory.
